It involves controlling 4 mobile robots so that they cover the maximum area possible inside a polygon. You can find more info at [nlamprian.me](https://nlamprian.me/project/robotics/control/2012-09-24-voronoi-diagrams).

Dependencies
------------

The code relies on the following MATLAB libraries: [`polycenter`](http://www.biomecardio.com/matlab/polycenter.html), [`myaa`](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20979-myaa-my-anti-alias-for-matlab), [`export_fig`](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig), and the `Mapping Toolbox`.

Execution
---------

To execute the code, download the required dependencies and drop the libraries inside the repo's root folder. Then, inside MATLAB, navigate to the repo's folder, and simply execute:

```
